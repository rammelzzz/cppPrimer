It can be easier to understand complicated pointer or reference declarations if
you read them from right to left.

example:
int i = 0;
int *p;
int *&r = p;

The easiest way to understand the type of r is to read the definition right to left. The
symbol closest to the name of the variable (in this case the & in &r) is the one that
has the most immediate effect on the variableâ€™s type. Thus, we know that r is a
reference. The rest of the declarator determines the type to which r refers. The next
symbol, * in this case, says that the type r refers to is a pointer type. Finally, the
base type of the declaration says that r is a reference to a pointer to an int.
